Vim ensures that vimscript and lua files in this directory are sourced AFTER
all the plugin scripts in "plugin" directories are sourced.
"Lazy loading" with lazy.nvim plugin manager complicates matters for the
functionality of this directory.
This is the ideal place for static, post-initialization customizations that are
not incorporated into the plugin manager configuration. These could be
auto-commands, key-maps,... etc.
If some customizations need 2 or more plugins to be loaded, putting them here
ensures that both of them are loaded before config scripts here are sourced.
(Assuming plugins are installed and loaded in the first place!)
